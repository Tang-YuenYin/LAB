1) Move Ticket Queue
2) Queue first in first out Stack last In last out
3)(a) 14523
  (b) No, bcs Queue uses first in first out. So it is not logical for 4 to come b4 2 
      This sequence can only exist in this input sequence True False True False True False
      So printed 1,3,5
      and in the queue: 2,4
      Based on first in first out ,2 must exit first
      Therefore, it is not possible for 4 to come first
  (c) True True True True TRue
      False False False False False
      True True True False False
4)(a) 5
  (b) 7
  (c) 7
  (d) 9
5)-isEmpty()- return tru
