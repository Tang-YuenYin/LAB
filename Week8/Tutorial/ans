 Explanation:
 universal gate: NAND gate & NOR gate
 Java is converts code to HashCode 
 input java sometimes use sign function (+1,-1)
 so it turns the hascode into (1,0)
 (<0.5 =0 >0.5 =1)
 
 exp:
 It might be caused by the differences between two inputs
 like this : but this is not the case for this
      101100
(-)   100000

Therefore,it is a bit "random" 
 This happens due to pQueue.iterator()
 Havent have an accurate answer
